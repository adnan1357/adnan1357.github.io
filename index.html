      <h3>Adnan Habib</h3>
      <p> Hi I am Adnan Habib, a undergraduate student here at City University of London, studying computer science. 
          I have always had an interest in programming. I started to code at the age of 13 by learning lua, I then moved on to python
          where I learnt all the building blocks to a progamming langauge. From there I worked with VisualBasic, html, css and php
          and now I am learning Java. My hobbies include going to the gym, playing football and reading.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Processing game</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of arrays, loops, and randomness. I created a small game where you are a small ball and you have to
    collect as much food as you can while avoiding the bouncing balls. The bouncing balls have a random trajectory
    and the food respawn in random locations. The score is counted and saved.

        <h3>Java game project</h3>
        <p>
        I created a top down game in java, using the city engine. Here I was exposed to object oriented programming,
        encapsulation, composition, polymorphism, inheritance, overriding and much more. It was a great oppurtunity to
        enhance my programming skills and showcase my talents.
